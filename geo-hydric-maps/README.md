# Geological and Hydric Data and Maps

This folder references a series of hydrological maps related to the 2024 flooding event in Rio Grande do Sul, particularly in Porto Alegre. These maps were created through voluntary efforts and provided critical insights into the event's impact, offering before-and-after comparisons, impact assessments, and advanced analyses of the flood's effects. 
Most datasets are references (temporarly) because is too large for GitHub. Below are links to the specific maps and data sources:

1. **Before and After Map Comparison**  
   A comparison of satellite imagery showing the affected areas in Porto Alegre before and after the flood.

6. **Areas Prone to Mass Movements**  
   This material was developed to assist in the prevention of disasters related to mass movements in the analyzed region. The analyses are subject to uncertainties associated with local topography and soil parameters. The fact that a specific region is classified as susceptible to mass movements does not guarantee that it will certainly be affected, but it indicates a higher likelihood compared to other areas.  
   
   **Content**: Delimitation of areas prone to mass movements for municipalities in the Vale do Taquari region. The following municipalities were fully analyzed: Lajeado, Estrela, Arroio do Meio, Colinas, Roca Sales, Encantado, Muçum, Santa Tereza, Capitão, Imigrante, Coronel Pilar, and Monte Belo do Sul. The municipalities of Forquetinha, Marques de Souza, Travesseiro, Nova Bréscia, Relvado, Doutor Ricardo, Anta Gorda, Vespasiano Corrêa, São Valentim do Sul, Cotiporã, Garibaldi, Westfália, and Teotônia were partially analyzed.

Please note that while these maps provide invaluable information for understanding the hydric and geological impacts of the event, for their use you must contact the authors.

The Instituto de Pesquisas Hidráulicas (IPH) – Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) is one of the main sources for this data. The IPH is renowned for its extensive research in hydrology and water-related environmental studies, providing critical data for understanding and managing natural disasters, including floods and mass movements in southern Brazil.
